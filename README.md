Summary
-------

polifluence combines ProPublica's congress and member APIs with MapLight special interest data
to show the influence behind legislation.

You can search for a bill to find its sponsor and charts showing which special interest groups have lobbied for and against it. You can search for a legislator to find bills they've sponsored, their voting record, and charts showing how frequently they vote across party lines.
